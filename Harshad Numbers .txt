Harshad Numbers 
Max Score: 20

Given an integer N, check whether it is a Harshad number or not.

Note that a Harshad number is an integer, that is divisible by the sum of its digits.



Input

The first and only line of input contains a integer - N.



Output

Print "Yes" if the number is Harshad number, "No" otherwise.



Constraints

1 <= N <= 109



Example

Input

18



Output

Yes



Explanation



18 / (1 + 8) = 2

As 18 is divisible by the sum of its digits, it is a Harshad number.

n=int(input())
def harshad(n):
    str_n=str(n)
    sum_digit=sum(int(digit) for digit in str_n)

    return n%sum_digit == 0
if harshad(n):
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
