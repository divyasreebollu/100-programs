Repeated Numbers 
You are given an array of N elements. All elements of the array are in range 1 to N-2. All elements occur once except two numbers, which occur twice. Your task is to find the two repeating numbers.



Input Format

The first line of input contains T - the number of test cases. It's followed by 2T lines, the first line contains N - the size of the array and second line contains the elements of the array.



Output Format

Print the 2 repeated numbers in sorted manner, for each test case, separated by new line.



Constraints

30 points

1 <= T <= 100

4 <= N <= 103



70 points

1 <= T <= 100

4 <= N <= 106
