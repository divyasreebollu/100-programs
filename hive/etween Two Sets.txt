between Two Sets
You will be given two arrays of integers and asked to determine all integers that satisfy the following two conditions:

The elements of the first array are all factors of the integer being considered
The integer being considered is a factor of all elements of the second array
These numbers are referred to as being between the two arrays. You must determine how many such numbers exist.

For example, given the arrays a = [2, 6] and b = [24, 36], there are two numbers between them: 6 and 12. 6 % 2 = 0, 6 % 6 = 0, 24 % 6 = 0 and 36 % 6 = 0 for the first value. Similarly, 12 % 2 = 0, 12 % 6 = 0 and 24 % 12 = 0, 36 % 12 = 0.


Function Description
Complete the getTotalX function in the editor below. It should return the number of integers that are betwen the sets.

getTotalX has the following parameter(s):

a: an array of integers
b: an array of integers

Input Format
The first line contains two space-separated integers, n and m, the number of elements in array and the number of elements in array b. The second line contains n distinct space-separated integers describing a[i] where . The third line contains m distinct space-separated integers describing b[i] where .


Constraints



Output Format
Print the number of integers that are considered to be between a and b.


Sample Input
2 3
2 4
16 32 96

Sample Output
3

Explanation
2 and 4 divide evenly into 4, 8, 12 and 16.
4, 8 and 16 divide evenly into 16, 32, 96.
4, 8 and 16 are the only three numbers for which

To solve this problem, you can find the numbers that are factors of all elements in array b and are divisible by all elements in array a. Here's the implementation:

python
Copy code
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def gcd_array(arr):
    result = arr[0]
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        result = gcd(result, arr[i])
    return result

def lcm_array(arr):
    result = arr[0]
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        result = lcm(result, arr[i])
    return result

def get_total_x(a, b):
    lcm_a = lcm_array(a)
    gcd_b = gcd_array(b)
    
    count = 0
    multiple = lcm_a
    while multiple <= gcd_b:
        if gcd_b % multiple == 0:
            count += 1
        multiple += lcm_a

    return count

# Input
n, m = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
b = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Output
print(get_total_x(a, b))
This code defines functions to calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) and the least common multiple (lcm) of two numbers, as well as for arrays of numbers. Then, it calculates the lcm of array a and the gcd of array b, and finds how many multiples of the lcm are factors of the gcd. This gives the count of numbers that are considered to be between the two arrays.
