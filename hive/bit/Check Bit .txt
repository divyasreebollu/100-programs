Check Bit 
Given an integer N, check whether the ith bit is set or not.



Input Format

The first and only line of input contains N and i.



Output Format

Print "true" if the ith bit is set in the given integer N, "false" otherwise.



Constraints

0 <= N <= 109

0 <= i <= 30



Example

Input

10 1



Output

true



Explanation



The binary form of 10 is `1010`. So, the 1st bit in 10 is set. Note that the LSB bit is referred to as the 0th bit.
