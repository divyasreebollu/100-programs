Given an integer array A of size N. You have to construct a new B array with a length of (N+N). For each index i from 0 to N-1, the value of B[i] should be same as the value of A[i], and the value of B[i+N] should also be same as value of A[i].
In simple terms, you have to duplicate the A array and place them consecutively in the B array two times.

Input Format

First line of input contains N - size of the array A. The next line contains N integers of array A.

Constraints

1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= A[i] <= 1000

Output Format

Print the elements of the B array separated by space.
