X and Y set bits 
Given two numbers X and Y, find the number whose binary representation has its Xth and Yth bits set to 1 and remaining bits set to 0.



Input Format

The first line of input contains T - the number of test cases. It's followed by T lines. Each subsequent line contains two integers: X - the index of the first set bit and Y - the index of the second set bit, separated by a space.



Output Format

For each test case, print the number whose binary representation has its Xth and Yth bits set to 1 and the remaining bits set to zero, separated by a new line.

Since this number can be very large, print the result % 1000000007.



Constraints

30 points

1 <= T <= 100

0 <= X,Y <= 30



70 points

1 <= T <= 105

0 <= X,Y <= 105

Explanation



Test-Case 1

The binary representation of the number that has bits at position 3 and 4 set is 11000 = 24



Test-Case 2

The binary representation of the number that has the bit at position 5 and 0 set is 100001 


t=int(input())
while t>0:
    x,y=map(int,input().split())
    t=t-1
    print(((1<<y)|(1<<x))%1000000007)



Test-Case 1:

Input: 
𝑋
=
4
X=4, 
𝑌
=
3
Y=3
(
1
<
<
4
)
=
16
(1<<4)=16 (which is 10000 in binary)
(
1
<
<
3
)
=
8
(1<<3)=8 (which is 01000 in binary)
Combining them: 
16
∣
8
=
24
16∣8=24 (which is 11000 in binary)
Test-Case 2:

Input: 
𝑋
=
5
X=5, 
𝑌
=
0
Y=0
(
1
<
<
5
)
=
32
(1<<5)=32 (which is 100000 in binary)
(
1
<
<
0
)
=
1
(1<<0)=1 (which is 000001 in binary)
Combining them: 
32∣1=33
32∣1=33 (which is 100001 in binary)
Test-Case 3:

Input: 
𝑋
=
15
X=15, 
𝑌
=
30
Y=30
(1<<15)
=
32768
(1<<15)=32768 (which is a large binary number with a single bit set at position 15)
(
1
<
<
30
)
=
1073741824
(1<<30)=1073741824 (which is a large binary number with a single bit set at position 30)
Combining them: 
32768
∣
1073741824
=
1073774592
32768∣1073741824=1073774592
